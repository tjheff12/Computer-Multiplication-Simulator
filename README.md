# Computer-Multiplication-Simulator

This is a C program to simulate how a computer multiplies two numbers. It prints to the command line each step of the multiplication process of the carry bit, adder, multiplicand, and mulitplier.

To run this after cloning, do "Make" then "Make run". When finished, you can delete the compilied files using "Make clean".

This was done in the Fall 2020 semseter for CPSC 2310 - Intro to Computer Organization.
